			<h3 style="width:30%">Way back when...</h3>
			<p style="width:50%">Catoctin Mountain Orchard was started in 1948 when <strong>Harry Black</strong>, who was working for the owner Ira Kelbaugh, helped start and build an open-air retail market just north of Thurmont, Maryland along Rt. 15.
			<br><br>
			70% of the 100 acres of Apple and Peaches were sold to truckers and the wholesale markets in Baltimore and the Washington-Virginia areas. Harry and Helen Black then purchased the farm from Mr. Kelbaugh in 1961 and built several additions to the open air retail market.  And In 1983 they decided to close up the “open air” market and build a 50’x50′ addition. Several changes were made over the next seven years including building three cold storage rooms in 1964 & 1968, four Irrigation ponds and an Apple grader to wash and size the Apples.</p>

			<p style="width:40%">The second and fourth generations of the Black family!
			<br><br>As the farm grew and different types of produce were grown, having enough labor became a challenge in the late 1980s and the family decided to hire part-time labor to help out the full-time employees with pruning and harvesting. The farm was very fortunate to hire four Mexican men to help and these men have been with the farm ever since and are a very important part of its success.</p>
